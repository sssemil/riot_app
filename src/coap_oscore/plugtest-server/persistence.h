/**
 * @file
 *
 * This is a simple ad-hoc flash memory backing for the data the demo
 * application needs to persist in order to be runnable without a computer
 * attached to it.
 *
 * The underlying flash mechanism is crude in that it mirrors the complete
 * flash area in RAM, always writes a full black to flash, uses duplication
 * rather than checksumming and can not recover from a write that is aborted by
 * loss of power during @ref persistence_commit call (resulting in loss of the
 * security context).
 *
 * None of these properties are desirable for a real-world application, but as
 * RIOT lacks a generic journaling configuration storage mechanism, actual
 * applications will have their own mechanisms for commissioning and
 * configuration anyway, which can then provide more elaborate persistence.
 *
 * On native RIOT boards, the behavior of flash memory is emulated by reading
 * from and writing to a `persistence.flash` file, which is discarded when
 * found to be older than the current executable itself.
